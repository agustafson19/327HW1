    Finnished Assignment 1.06
    
    Added Fog of war, an 'f' command that toggles it, and a 'g' command that
    enables teleportation. Last monster locations are not seen, the fog of
    war does not appear while choosing where to teleport to. As per the
    spec, the mosnter list is completely unchanged, and thus lists all monsters.

    Modularised Code from 1.04
    
    Put the code from 1.04 into a collection of functions. Additionally, I
    fixed a bug from 1.04 that caused a core-corrupted error when there are
    more than 18 mostners by disabling the ability of the binary min-heap to
    contract.

    Finnished Part 4 of Assignment 1
    
    Implemented a move sequence using two heaps. Added methods that print a
    win and loose message. Player moves randomly and does not tunnel.
    Implemented monster movement to specification, reversed dijkstra's
    algorithm for that to happen. Revised the git_neighbor method to ignore
    the boarder.

Date:   Wed Mar 3 15:41:02 2021 -0600

    Added monster generation
    
    Monsters now generate; the number of monsters spawned can be chosen with
    --nummon; the default number of monsters spawned is 10; the heap was
    modified to free each of its members once deleted.
    
    Note: non-tunneling monsters only spawn within rooms, and do not spawn
    within corrodors, while tunneling monsters can spawn everywhere. This
    was done to increase the chance of a non-tunneling monster spawning, to
    bring it closer to fifty percent.

    Prepared for part four
    
    Changed priority_queue to heap, made stack and heap use void pointers,
    fixed how files include other files, re-wroked the makefile, created an
    archive folder for all the archives that I will submit for each part of
    this assignment, added a --nummon switch, and made the program print the
    num_monsters value.

    vertecies, djikstra's algorithm to populate arrays of distances from the

    of Assignment 1.02 that kept Hello.rlg327 has been delt with.
