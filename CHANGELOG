    Finnished Part 4 of Assignment 1
    
    Implemented a move sequence using two heaps. Added methods that print a
    win and loose message. Player moves randomly and does not tunnel.
    Implemented monster movement to specification, reversed dijkstra's
    algorithm for that to happen. Revised the git_neighbor method to ignore
    the boarder.

    Added monster generation
    
    Monsters now generate; the number of monsters spawned can be chosen with
    --nummon; the default number of monsters spawned is 10; the heap was
    modified to free each of its members once deleted.
    
    Note: non-tunneling monsters only spawn within rooms, and do not spawn
    within corrodors, while tunneling monsters can spawn everywhere. This
    was done to increase the chance of a non-tunneling monster spawning, to
    bring it closer to fifty percent.

    Prepared for part four
    
    Changed priority_queue to heap, made stack and heap use void pointers,
    fixed how files include other files, re-wroked the makefile, created an
    archive folder for all the archives that I will submit for each part of
    this assignment, added a --nummon switch, and made the program print the
    num_monsters value.

    Added Xs where floor bound enemies cannot get to the player. The actual
    value of these within the distance array is 0xFFFF.

    Finnished Assignment 1.03
    
    Implemented a vertex struct, a stack of verticies, a minimal priority queue of
    vertecies, djikstra's algorithm to populate arrays of distances from the
    player character, code that draws them. The bug that existed at the end
    of Assignment 1.02 that kept Hello.rlg327 has been delt with.

    Adjusted size of temporary variables.
    
    Adjusted size of temporary variables used in iteration to be at least
    the size of those to which they go.
