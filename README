Light sources were added. 'LIT' is an optional attribute that must be added to the objects description class. Light sources expand the field of view of the player durring fog of war.

The 'L' command also identifies objects. Only things in sight can be identified. Preference is given to monsters, and then items on the top of a stack.

The shoot function models an attempt for one character to shoot another character with a ranged weapon, using ammunition.

Shots fired ignore defence, but the damage dealt is solely determined by the damage of the weapon, and of the amunition.

Currently, anything seen can be shot. Ranged weapons ignore walls, and can shoot anywhere with for of war turned off.

Saving and loading game states were attempted, but could not be done in the time I had.
