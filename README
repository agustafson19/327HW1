Name: Arvid Gustafson

Added a --nummon switch.

Added a vector struct, which functions the same as a vertex, but allows for negative numbers

Added a character struct, which functions as a character, which could be the player of a mosnter
    - Specialization between the character and monster data hasn't been done yet

Added the init_character_map function, which initialises a character map

Added the init_player function, which initialises the player

Added the generate_monsters function, which generates all of the monsters

Added the init_distance_map, which initializes a distance map
    - This should be unnecessary, but was added durring debugging, and does not break anything

Reversed the dijkstra function

Altered the get_neighbors function to ignore the edges

Added the draw_win, which draws a basic win message

Added the draw_loose funciton, which draws a basic lose message
    - Typo does not break code

Implemented all move and combat logic within the main function
    - Will modularise later
