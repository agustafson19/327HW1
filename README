The main function currently prints out the monster list loaded from HOME/.rlg327/monster_desc.txt
 
The dice class was added. This represents a basic statistic, with a base value, a number of times a dice that will be rolled, and the number of sides thereon. The toss function resembles a number derived from the three integer values, but it has not been tested.

The monster_template struct was added, as a template, or type, of monster.

The load_monster_dictionary function loads a monster dictionary from HOME/.rlg327/monster_desc.txt, and it returns an error code. 0 means no errors were detected. 1 means "RLG327 MONSTER DESCRIPTION 1" was not the first line. 2 means an invalid color was recieved. 3 means an invalid ability was recieved. 4 means an invalid property was recieved. 5 means insufficient properties were recieved.


The print_monster_dictionary function prints a monster dictionary using cout.
