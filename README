ARVID GUSTAFSON

All code was converted to C++.

All structs were made into classes with public fields.

FOG and TELEPORT masks were added, and the size of the characteristics fields fo the character struct was increased.

The teleport_command function facilitates selecting a point to teleport to; it can be given some character map to display while making the selection; it goes until either:
    a) The player chooses a point to teleport to with 'g'
    b) The player cancels the action with ESCAPE
    c) The player quits with 'Q'

Teleporting does not count as a turn, but does behave like a move, so it does kill monsters.

The sketch_visible_map function updates the visual map with information from the (base) map and the character map; monster positions are not remembered.

As per the spec, no changes were made to the monster list, so all the monsters are shown thereon.
